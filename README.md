2-satisfiability (2-SAT) is a specific form of the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) where each clause in the formula has exactly two literals. It is a special case of the more general k-satisfiability problem (k-SAT), which is NP-complete for  ùëò ‚â• 3 k‚â•3, but 2-SAT can be solved in polynomial time.
